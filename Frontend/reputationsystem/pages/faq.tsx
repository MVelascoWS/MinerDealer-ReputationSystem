            <h1>Methodology</h1>
            <p>Reputation systems allow customers to identify which miner they can do business with, be it storage or recovery. It also works as a reference for those platforms that want to grant a loan to a miner; studying their performance, commitment and behavior. Likewise, miners can take it as a guide to improve their service.</p>
            <p>The reputation system must be based on all the actors of the Filecoin ecosystem, calculating and publishing the scores in order to quantify through a percentage the qualification of the different areas to be evaluated, without failing to attend to all the participants in the ecosystem and receiving feedback from new improvements they can propose</p>
